## Overview

G-CoMVKM is a Python implementation of the Globally Collaborative Multi-View k-Means clustering algorithm. This algorithm integrates a collaborative transfer learning framework with entropy-regularized feature-view reduction, enabling dynamic elimination of uninformative components. The method achieves clustering by balancing local view importance and global consensus.

### Key Features

- **Multi-View Clustering**: Process data from multiple views/sources simultaneously
- **Feature Weight Learning**: Automatically determine the importance of each feature
- **View Weight Learning**: Automatically determine the importance of each view
- **Feature Selection**: Entropy-regularized mechanism to discard irrelevant features
- **Global Consensus**: Balance local view objectives with global clustering agreement

## Installation

You can install G-CoMVKM directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install gcomvkm
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use G-CoMVKM:

```python
from gcomvkm import GCoMVKM
from gcomvkm.utils import load_synthetic_data
from gcomvkm.evaluation import nmi, rand_index, adjusted_rand_index

# Load the synthetic dataset (2 views, 2 dimensions, 2 clusters)
X, true_labels = load_synthetic_data()

# Create and fit the model
model = GCoMVKM(
    n_clusters=2,
    gamma=5.0,     # Feature selection regularization parameter
    theta=4.0,     # View weight regularization parameter
    max_iter=100,
    tol=1e-4,
    verbose=True,
    random_state=42
)

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(X)

# Get the clustering results
predicted_labels = model.labels_
feature_weights = model.feature_weights_
view_weights = model.view_weights_

# Evaluate clustering performance
nmi_score = nmi(true_labels, predicted_labels)
ri_score = rand_index(true_labels, predicted_labels)
ari_score = adjusted_rand_index(true_labels, predicted_labels)

print(f"NMI Score: {nmi_score:.4f}")
print(f"Rand Index: {ri_score:.4f}")
print(f"Adjusted Rand Index: {ari_score:.4f}")
```

## Algorithm Description

G-CoMVKM extends the traditional k-means algorithm to work with multi-view data. The algorithm:

1. **Initializes** cluster centers randomly or using k-means++
2. **Computes memberships** for each data point to the clusters
3. **Updates cluster centers** based on these memberships
4. **Updates feature weights** using an entropy-regularized optimization
5. **Discards irrelevant features** based on a threshold
6. **Updates view weights** to balance view importance
7. **Repeats** steps 2-6 until convergence

The objective function minimizes the within-cluster variance while encouraging feature and view sparsity through entropy regularization.

## CLI Usage

G-CoMVKM also provides a command-line interface:

```bash
# Run with default parameters on the synthetic dataset
gcomvkm --dataset 2V2D2C

# Run with custom parameters
gcomvkm --dataset 2V2D2C --gamma 5.0 --theta 4.0 --n-clusters 2 --max-iter 100
```

ABSTRACT = {Multi-view (MV) data are increasingly collected from various fields, like IoT. The surge in MV data demands clustering algorithms capable of handling heterogeneous features and high dimensionality. Existing feature-weighted MV k-means (MVKM) algorithms often neglect effective dimensionality reduction such that their scalability and interpretability are limited. To address this, we propose a novel procedure for clustering MV data, namely a globally collaborative MVKM (G-CoMVKM) clustering algorithm. The proposed G-CoMVKM integrates a collaborative transfer learning framework with entropy-regularized feature-view reduction, enabling dynamic elimination of uninformative components. This method achieves clustering by balancing local view importance and global consensus, without relying on matrix reconstruction. We design a feature-view reduction by embedding transferred learning processes across view components by using penalty terms and entropy to simultaneously reduce these unimportant feature-view components. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that G-CoMVKM consistently outperforms these existing MVKM clustering algorithms in clustering accuracy, performance, and dimensionality reduction, affirming its robustness and efficiency.},

## Note

The original code has been tested on MATLAB R2020a. Performance on other versions may vary. This Python implementation has been tested on Python 3.7+ and is compatible with most modern Python environments.

### ðŸ’« Beyond the "Impossible"

As Arthur C. Clarke said, "The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible."

We didn't just ventureâ€”we blazed a trail:

- Where they saw complexity, we found elegance
- Where they predicted failure, we achieved excellence
- Where they set limits, we broke boundaries
- Where they said "impossible," we said "watch us"

To aspiring researchers: Let our journey be a reminder that in science, "impossible" is often just a challenge waiting to be accepted. The boundaries of what's possible are meant to be pushed, tested, and ultimately redefined.
